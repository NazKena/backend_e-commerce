The way this application works is that when a functional Express.js API is given, and I have added my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then it will connect to a database using sequalise. When schema command `mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -p`and seed command `npm run seed` are entered, then a development database is created. When command `nodemon server.js` is invoked, then the server starts and sequlize models are syncde to the MYSQL database. Using INSOMNIA, I was able to GET, PUT,POST and DELETE for routes `product-route.js`, `category-route.js` and `tag-route.js`.
